.SH NAME
embed \- embed virtual machine
.SH SYNOPSIS
embed out.blk in.blk file.fth
.SH DESCRIPTION
A simple and compact Forth Virtual machine, derived from the H2 CPU
(from <https://github.com/howerj/forth-cpu>, which in turn derives from the J1
CPU). 

.SH OPTIONS

All command line arguments are optional, the meaning of the option is given
by its position within the argument list. If any option is missing then a
default is used.

.TP
.B out.blk
This option supplies a file for any 'save' instructions to write a block to,
if no 'out.blk' option is supplied the saving fails. This may be the same
file name as given by 'in.blk'.

.TP
.B in.blk
This option supplies a file to be used as the initial virtual machine image,
this will be loaded at startup. If no 'in.blk' file is provided then one of
two things may happen depending on how 'embed' was compiled, either it will
attempt to read from a default file ('embed.blk') in the same directory or
it will use a default image built into the executable. This behavior can
be specified at compile time. The built in image, if available, contains a
fully working eForth interpreter.

.TP
.B file.fth
This option supplies a file to read from, by default the virtual machine
will read from stdin(3).

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
.B ./embed

.B ./embed in.blk
